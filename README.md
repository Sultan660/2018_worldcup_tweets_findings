## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This Project we are trying to answer three questions based on data collected from Twitter by Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/rgupta09/world-cup-2018-tweets 

The Questions:

What are the most 10 hashtags mentioned during the 2018 World Cup?
Does the number followers help to get the most likes? Does high number of followers is a key to get the most high likes in 2018 world cup?
What are the most countries tweets in the 2018 world cup?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The notebook available here showcases work related to the above questions.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The study shows that #Fra is the most hashtag mentioned, which seems logic because it won by France. Besides, the number of followers can play a good role in getting high likes but it is not always, the key on getting high likes is fans. While, Nigeria nation shows a great interest on the 2018 world cup.
